A Solana Framework for JavaScript clients.

Umi is a modular framework for building and using JavaScript clients for Solana programs. It provides a zero-dependency library that defines a set of core interfaces that libraries can rely on without being tied to a specific implementation. It is then up to the end-user to choose the implementation that best suits their needs. Umi also provides a set of default implementations and bundles that can be used out of the box allowing developers to get started quickly. {% .lead %}
